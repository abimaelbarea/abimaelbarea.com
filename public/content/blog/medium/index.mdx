# Exploring the Front-end Ecosystems by Numbers

A deep comparison of Angular, React, and Vue.

![Image](http://localhost:3000/content/blog/medium/frameworks.png)

This article aims to explore the current situation of these three ecosystems. I’m not trying to share my thoughts or opinions; I only want to analyze actual data.

## Ecosystems Research

I’m going to focus the research on the three main front-end ecosystems at the moment; even if **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is rising in popularity** mainly due to [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), I want to study the situation of the three big players:

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)

The insights extracted to develop this article come from the following resources:

- [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=%2Fm%2F012l1vxv,%2Fg%2F11c6w0ddw9,%2Fg%2F11c0vmgx5d)
- [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-webframe-prof)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [NPM Trends](https://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-vue-vs-@angular/core)

## Situation

These are the numbers extracted (January 2022).

| Name    | V        | Starts  | Forks   | PRs Closed | Contributors | Weekley downloads | Global  | Professional | Popularity (0-100) |
| ------- | -------  | ------- | ------- | -------    | -------      | -------           | ------- | -------      | -------            |
| Angular | 13       | 78.7k   | 20.7k   | 20k        | 1.5k         | 1.6m              | 22.96%  | 26.23%       | 26                 |
| React   | 17       | 180k    | 36.6k   | 11.4k      | 1.5k         | 8m                | 40.14%  | 40.14%       | 50                 |
| Vue     | 3        | 192k    | 31.1k   | 1.9k       | 404          | 1.7m              | 18.97%  | 18.97%       | 14                 |

> ***Important!** Those numbers reflect the situation based on websites commonly used by developers worldwide. Still, in the Chinese development environment, there are some alternative resources like: [Baidu Trends](https://index.baidu.com/v2/index.html), [Segment Fault](https://segmentfault.com/), [Gitee](https://gitee.com/), [csdn](https://www.csdn.net/)*

## Usage

Let’s take a look at the numbers related to the usage of those libs.

| Name    | Starts  | Forks   | PRs Closed | Contributors | Weekley downloads |
| ------- | ------- | ------- | -------    | -------      | -------           |
| Angular | 78.7k   | 20.7k   | 20k        | 1.5k         | 1.6m              |
| React   | 180k    | 36.6k   | 11.4k      | 1.5k         | 8m                |
| Vue     | 192k    | 31.1k   | 1.9k       | 404          | 1.7m              |

- React is the most downloaded.
- React, and Vue doubles the starts of Angular.

## Popularity

| Name    | Popularity (0-100) |
| ------- | -------            |
| Angular | 26                 |
| React   | 50                 |
| Vue     | 14                 |

It seems that React is the one with the highest rate within Google's popularity but let’s study the searches across the world.

> Last 5 years.

> Last year.

![Last year](http://localhost:3000/content/blog/medium/1year.png)

- Angular words have decreased significantly in that period.
- **Vue is the most searched in China.**

> ***Important!** Baidu is the most used search engine in [China (94%)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/257592/share-of-baidu-users-by-country/), so within Baidu insights the popularity will probably be Vue first, followed by React and Angular.*

Another way of analyzing popularity is developer surveys, and in this case, we could look at StackOverflow's.

| Name    | Global  | Professional |
| ------- | ------- | -------      |
| Angular | 22.96%  | 26.23%       |
| React   | 40.14%  | 40.14%       |
| Vue     | 18.97%  | 18.97%       |

- React is the most popular in StackOverflow’s professional and general usage popularity.

> ***Important!** SegmentFault performed, during 2020, [a survey about development](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000039910514), and from 510 people, the results for frontend frameworks were completely different: 
Vue 47.1% vs. React 13.7%
Another point of view in that direction is the one of [vue-view](https://vue-view.com/why-vue-js-is-trending-in-china-how-popular-vue-is-there/).*

## Conclusions

Front-end development has changed a lot in the last 25 years. Let’s analyze the evolution:

- **Before 2010:** [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was the one that monopolized the environment.
- **During 2010–2020:** CSR's rise [(Client Side Rendering)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction) and Angular, React, and Vue appears.
- **Starting in 2020:** [SSR (Server Side Rendering)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side) and [SSG (Static Site Generation)](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) are getting popular, and frameworks like [Scully](https://scully.io/) (Angular), [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (React), and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) (Vue) are evolving in that direction.

I like parts and ideas of all of them, and I’m actively following their evolution.

Based on the short history of front-end development, the only thing that I can say is that *nothing is permanent*, and it’s crucial to **Never Stop Learning**.
